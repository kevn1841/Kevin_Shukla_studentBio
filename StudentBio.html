			<p>This is a picture of Kevin, an average guy from Sayreville, NJ. Having been born in a tech-savvy family, he thought that it was only right to continue on with the tradition of learning about anything tech related- he chose full stack web development. At this very moment, he is studying at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.</p>
